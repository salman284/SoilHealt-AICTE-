# Soil Health Monitoring and Management System
## Problem Statement

### 1. Introduction and Background

Agriculture is the backbone of global food security, supporting over 7.8 billion people worldwide. However, soil degradation poses a significant threat to sustainable agricultural productivity. According to the United Nations, approximately 33% of the world's arable land has been lost to erosion or pollution in the past 40 years. Poor soil health directly impacts crop yields, farmer livelihoods, and global food security.

Traditional soil health assessment methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often provide limited spatial and temporal coverage. Farmers typically rely on periodic soil testing that may not capture the dynamic nature of soil conditions, leading to suboptimal fertilization practices, reduced crop yields, and environmental degradation.

### 2. Problem Definition
