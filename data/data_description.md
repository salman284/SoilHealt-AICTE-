## Use Cases

### Classification Tasks
1. **Soil Health Classification**: Classify soil health into categories (Poor: 0-40, Fair: 40-70, Good: 70-100)
2. **Degradation Risk Prediction**: Predict soil degradation risk level
3. **Fertilizer Type Recommendation**: Recommend optimal fertilizer type

### Regression Tasks

2. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Capture complex non-linear relationships
3. **Random Forest**: Handle mixed data types and feature importance
4. **K-Means Clustering**: Identify soil management zones
5. **Gradient Boosting**: High accuracy for yield prediction

### Feature Engineering Opportunities
1. **Interaction Terms**: pH × Nutrient content, Temperature × Moisture
2. **Temporal Features**: Seasonal averages, trends
3. **Ratios**: NPK ratios, Sand-to-Clay ratio
4. **Binning**: Categorize continuous variables for better interpretation

## Data Preprocessing Notes

### Scaling Requirements
- Numerical features have different scales and require standardization
- Consider robust scaling for features with outliers
- Log transformation may benefit skewed distributions

### Categorical Encoding
- Use one-hot encoding for fertilizer_type and crop_rotation
- Consider ordinal encoding for soil_degradation_risk
- Label encoding suitable for season (if temporal order matters)

### Outlier Handling
- Some extreme values are realistic (e.g., high salinity in certain soils)
- Use domain knowledge to distinguish between outliers and valid extremes
- Consider isolation forest for multivariate outlier detection

## Validation Strategy

### Temporal Validation
- Split data by time periods to test model stability
- Use 2023 data for training, 2024 for testing

### Geographical Validation
- Split by regions to test spatial generalization
- Consider cross-validation across different climate zones

### Cross-Validation
- Use stratified k-fold for classification tasks
- Ensure balanced representation of seasons and regions

## Limitations and Considerations

### Synthetic Nature
- Data is generated based on domain knowledge and statistical models
- May not capture all real-world complexities and edge cases
- Should be validated against real field measurements

### Simplifications
- Assumes independence of some correlated factors
- Does not include soil microbiology or pest factors
- Weather patterns simplified compared to real climate variations

### Model Assumptions
- Linear and non-linear relationships based on agricultural science
- Some interactions may be oversimplified
- Regional variations averaged across large geographic areas

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Features
- Soil microbial activity indicators
- Heavy metal content
- Pesticide residue levels
- Crop disease history

### Real Data Integration
- Incorporate actual sensor measurements
- Add satellite imagery features
- Include farm management system data

### Temporal Extensions
- Multi-year trends
- Seasonal decomposition
- Climate change projections
